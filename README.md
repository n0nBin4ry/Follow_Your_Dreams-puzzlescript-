# Follow_Your_Dreams-puzzlescript-
The game is now complete. I decided to stay in PuzzleScript. Maybe one day I will "remaster" it in GM2 or another engine.
If you're interested in learning more about the game visit my Medium page. The link can be found in the Links section of the readme.

- All versions (past, present, and future) dedicated to Don David (mi abuelo) and G-Cal (my friend).
